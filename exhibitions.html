            <p>For centuries, philosophers and scientists have wrestled with the question of our origins. Where do we
                come from and how did we get here? Since Darwin proposed his theory of evolution we have had a framework
                for exploring and understanding our place in this world.
                Discover the origins of life on this planet and how the species we know today have evolved our time. You
                can also take some time to meet a few of the creatures who didn’t survive, including our Woolly Mammoth,
                the Dodos, and a number of dinosaurs too.

                <p>As we learn more and more of the impact humans are having on the planet, the more
                    important it becomes that scientists explore how to create a sustainable future not just
                    for humans but for the whole planet.
                    In our ecology section of the museum, we unpack the dangers we currently face including
                    global warming, extinction of species, and pollution. But we also focus on the positive
